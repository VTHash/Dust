## Why do I need 0.001 ETH?

The **0.001 ETH minimum balance** is an on-chain requirement that helps reduce automated abuse and multi-wallet farming.  
It is **not a fee** paid to anyone. You keep your ETH in your wallet.  
You still pay standard network gas fees for the claim transaction.

## Claim Status Explained

On the page, you will see:

- **Can claim now**
  - `YES` means you can claim immediately
  - `NO (...)` means you cannot claim yet, and the reason will be shown

Common reasons:
- **Insufficient ETH balance** — you have less than 0.001 ETH
- **Too soon** — you claimed within the last 24 hours
- **Window ended** — your 180-day claim window has finished
- **Paused** — claiming has been temporarily disabled
- **Cap reached** — the maximum total supply has been reached

---

## Countdown Timer (Next Claim)

The app includes a **live countdown timer** so you can see exactly when you can claim again.

- If you have claimed before, it shows: `Claim in HH:MM:SS`
- When the timer reaches zero, it will show: `Ready now`

Note: eligibility is still enforced on-chain. If you don’t meet the ETH requirement or your window ended, the claim will not work even if the timer hits zero.

---

## Claim Window (6 Months)

Your claim window starts **only when you make your first claim**.

- If you have never claimed before:
  - the window has not started
  - you can claim immediately (if you meet the ETH minimum)
- Once you claim the first time:
  - you have **180 days** to claim daily
- After 180 days:
  - you cannot claim anymore from that wallet

## Troubleshooting

### “MetaMask not detected”
Install MetaMask (browser extension) and refresh the page.

### “Wrong network”
Switch to **Linea Mainnet** when prompted.

### “Insufficient ETH balance”
Add ETH to your wallet until you have **at least 0.001 ETH** (plus gas for the claim).

### “Too soon”
You have already claimed in the last 24 hours. Wait for the countdown to reach zero.

### Transaction fails / reverts
Common reasons:
- cooldown not finished
- claim window ended
- contract is paused
- token cap reached
- you do not have enough ETH for gas
